This integration adds a Slack app to your workspace that posts a message every time a new request is created. It includes action buttons to interact with the request directly from Slack! You can claim, close, and re-open requests without leaving Slack. You can also convert a request to a ticket with a click of a button, which will open a browser page with all the details prefilled. Once a request has been converted to a ticket, the Slack message will automatically update to show the ticket details, and a new button will appear to view the ticket.
